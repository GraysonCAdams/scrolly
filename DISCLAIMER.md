# Disclaimer

## Software Provided "As Is"

Scrolly is open-source software distributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). It is provided **"as is"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors and contributors are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of this software.

## Content Responsibility

Scrolly is a private media playback and sharing platform. It enables users to share video and music links within private groups. On its own, Scrolly cannot download media from external platforms — the host must make a deliberate choice to install a third-party download provider from the Settings UI. **No download tools are bundled with, distributed by, or automatically installed by Scrolly.**

**You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of this software complies with:**

- The terms of service of any platform from which content is downloaded (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music)
- All applicable copyright and intellectual property laws in your jurisdiction
- Any other relevant local, state, national, or international laws and regulations

The Scrolly maintainers do not endorse, encourage, or condone the downloading or redistribution of copyrighted material without authorization. This software is intended for personal, private use among small friend groups.

## Self-Hosted Operator Responsibility

If you operate a self-hosted instance of Scrolly, **you assume full responsibility** for:

- All content downloaded, stored, and shared on your instance
- Compliance with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
- Compliance with telecommunications regulations related to SMS functionality
- Establishing and enforcing your own terms of service and privacy policy
- Content moderation within your instance
- Securing your deployment and protecting user data

The Scrolly maintainers have no control over and accept no responsibility for third-party deployments.

## Download Provider Consent

Scrolly does not automatically install, recommend, or endorse any specific download provider. By installing a download provider through the Settings UI, you acknowledge that:

- You have reviewed the provider's license and terms of use
- You accept sole responsibility for how the provider is used on your instance
- You will ensure that all downloads comply with applicable copyright laws and platform terms of service
- You understand that the Scrolly maintainers are not responsible for the provider's functionality, legality, or availability

This is an explicit opt-in action — Scrolly functions as a media playback and sharing platform without any download provider installed.

## Third-Party Services & Tools

Scrolly integrates with third-party services and tools that have their own terms and licenses:

- **[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com)** — SMS messaging
- **[Odesli](https://odesli.co)** — cross-platform music link resolution

Scrolly also supports optional third-party download providers that are **not bundled** with the software. These providers are independently installed by the host at runtime and are subject to their own licenses and terms of use. The host is solely responsible for their choice of provider.

The Scrolly maintainers are not affiliated with these services and make no guarantees about their availability, functionality, or terms.
