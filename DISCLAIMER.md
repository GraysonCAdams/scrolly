## Content Responsibility

Scrolly enables users to share video and music links within private groups. When a link is submitted, the software uses third-party download providers (installed at runtime by the host) to download media for private playback. **No download tools are bundled with or distributed by Scrolly.** The host explicitly chooses and installs a download provider from the Settings UI.

**You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of this software complies with:**

- The terms of service of any platform from which content is downloaded (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music)
- All applicable copyright and intellectual property laws in your jurisdiction
- Any other relevant local, state, national, or international laws and regulations

The Scrolly maintainers do not endorse, encourage, or condone the downloading or redistribution of copyrighted material without authorization. This software is intended for personal, private use among small friend groups.

## Self-Hosted Operator Responsibility

If you operate a self-hosted instance of Scrolly, **you assume full responsibility** for:

- All content downloaded, stored, and shared on your instance
- Compliance with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
- Compliance with telecommunications regulations related to SMS functionality
- Establishing and enforcing your own terms of service and privacy policy
- Content moderation within your instance
- Securing your deployment and protecting user data

The Scrolly maintainers have no control over and accept no responsibility for third-party deployments.

## Third-Party Services & Tools

Scrolly integrates with third-party services and tools that have their own terms and licenses:

- **[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com)** — SMS messaging

Scrolly also supports optional third-party download providers that are **not bundled** with the software. These providers are independently installed by the host at runtime and are subject to their own licenses and terms of use. The host is solely responsible for their choice of provider.
