# Runs CI and CodeQL on release-please PRs.
#
# Why this exists: release-please creates PRs using GITHUB_TOKEN, which does
# NOT trigger other workflows (pull_request events). pull_request_target IS
# triggered by GITHUB_TOKEN events because it runs in the base branch context.
# Without this, release PRs have no status checks and can't be merged when
# branch protection requires them.
#
# Security: restricted to release-please branches only. The checkout uses the
# PR's HEAD SHA, which is safe because release-please PRs come from within the
# same repository (not forks) and only modify version/changelog files.
