# TODO: Replace GITHUB_TOKEN with a GitHub App token to properly trigger
# CI/Security workflows on release-please PRs and docker-publish on releases.
# See: https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token
#
# Once configured, add to this workflow:
#   - name: Generate GitHub App token
#     id: app-token
#     uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
#     with:
#       app-id: ${{ vars.RELEASE_APP_ID }}
#       private-key: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
#
# Then pass `token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}` to release-please.
# This eliminates all workarounds for GITHUB_TOKEN event limitations.
