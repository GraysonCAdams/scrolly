<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="effective">Effective date: February 28, 2026</p>

<div class="notice">
  <strong>Open-Source Software Notice:</strong> Scrolly is open-source software released under the <a href="https://github.com/GraysonCAdams/scrolly/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT License</a>. These Terms of Service govern use of the official hosted instance operated by the Scrolly project maintainers. Self-hosted instances may run modified versions of the source code and are operated independently — their operators are solely responsible for establishing their own terms, compliance, and legal obligations. The Scrolly maintainers make no representations about third-party deployments.

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By accessing or using Scrolly ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>Scrolly is a private video-sharing application for small friend groups. Users can share video and music clips via a web interface or by texting links to the Service's phone number. The Service is invite-only — you must receive an invite code from an existing group to join.</p>

<h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service.</li>
  <li>You must have a valid phone number capable of receiving SMS messages.</li>
  <li>You must have received a valid invite code from a group administrator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Your Account</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your account is tied to your phone number. You are responsible for maintaining access to that phone number.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for all activity under your account.</li>
  <li>Do not share your verification codes with others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Share content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
  <li>Share content that infringes on intellectual property rights of others.</li>
  <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other accounts or the underlying systems.</li>
  <li>Use the Service to send spam, unsolicited messages, or automated bulk requests.</li>
  <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers.</li>
  <li>Use the Service for any commercial purpose without permission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Content</h2>
<h3>Your Content</h3>
<p>You retain ownership of any content you submit. By sharing content through the Service, you grant the Service a limited license to store, display, and distribute that content to members of your group for the purpose of operating the Service.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Content</h3>
<p>Clips shared through the Service often originate from third-party platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.). You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to share such content. The Service downloads and re-hosts clips for private group viewing. The Scrolly maintainers are not responsible for the content shared by users.</p>

<h2>7. SMS &amp; Messaging</h2>
<ul>
  <li>By providing your phone number during registration or login, you consent to receive transactional SMS messages including verification codes.</li>
  <li>By texting links to the Service's phone number, you consent to receive SMS replies confirming receipt of your submission.</li>
  <li>Message frequency varies based on your usage. Standard message and data rates from your carrier may apply.</li>
  <li>You may stop sending texts to the Service at any time. To stop receiving verification codes, do not initiate a login.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Group administrators may remove members from their group at any time.</li>
  <li>The Service maintainers may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</li>
  <li>You may request account deletion by contacting your group administrator or the project maintainers.</li>
  <li>Upon termination, your data will be removed as described in the <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Open-Source License &amp; Self-Hosting</h2>

  <li>The Scrolly source code is available under the <a href="https://github.com/GraysonCAdams/scrolly/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT License</a>.</li>
  <li>Anyone may fork, modify, and self-host Scrolly.</li>
  <li>Self-hosted instances are entirely independent. The Scrolly project maintainers do not control, endorse, or accept liability for third-party instances.</li>
  <li>Operators of self-hosted instances are responsible for their own compliance with applicable laws, including data protection, telecommunications regulations, and content moderation requirements.</li>
  <li>Modified versions may behave differently from the official source. Users of self-hosted instances should consult the operator of that instance for applicable terms and policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
